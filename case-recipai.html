  <p><em>Personal PM Case Study</em></p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Recipai is an AI-powered cooking assistant designed to help users plan meals and personalize their cooking experience.
</p>
<p>This case study highlights my individual product thinking and contributions within a team-based project.

  <h2>Trade-offs & Constraints</h2>
  <p>
    Due to time and scope constraints, advanced features such as nutrition tracking were deprioritized
    in favor of delivering a stable and usable MVP.
  </p>

  <h2>Outcome & Learnings</h2>
  <p>
    This project strengthened my ability to translate user needs into product decisions,
    balance scope and feasibility, and communicate product value clearly.
