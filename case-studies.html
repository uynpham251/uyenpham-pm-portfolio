  <h1>Recipai – AI Cooking Assistant</h1>
  <p><em>Group Case Study</em></p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Recipai is an AI-powered cooking assistant designed to help users plan meals and personalize their cooking experience.
</p>
<p>This case study highlights my individual product thinking and contributions within a team-based project.
  </p>

  <h2>Problem</h2>

    <li>Users struggle to decide what to cook on a daily basis</li>

  </ul>

  </ul>

  <h2>Goals</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Reduce decision fatigue when choosing meals</li>
    <li>Enable personalized recipe recommendations</li>
    <li>Simplify grocery planning</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Solution</h2>

    <li>AI Chat Assistant for recipe discovery and guidance</li>
    <li>Personalization settings for dietary preferences</li>
    <li>Smart shopping lists to streamline grocery preparation</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Trade-offs & Constraints</h2>
  <p>
    Due to time and scope constraints, advanced features such as nutrition tracking were deprioritized
    in favor of delivering a stable and usable MVP.
  </p>

  <h2>Outcome & Learnings</h2>
  <p>
    This project strengthened my ability to translate user needs into product decisions,
    balance scope and feasibility, and communicate product value clearly.
